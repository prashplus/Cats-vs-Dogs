# Cats VS Dogs

## Simple Classification with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

This repository will guide you to create simple CNN to classify Cats and Dogs after training it from the dataset provided by the Kaggle. The steps are pretty simple and most probably after going through this you will be ready to solve some image classification problems on your own.

## Prerequisites

I am assuming that you have basic understanding of the Neural Networks but many of you might not have working understanding of the CNN and couple of more stuffs. So, I have made a list that I suggest you to go through before prceeding further.

1. [CNN Explained by Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTr3n7uBIuE&t=13s)

2. Download the DataSet required for given tutorial to train and test the model from this link: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data)

3. The tutorial will be using Tensorflow as the ML library and TFlearn as the high level API to get in ease with Tensorflow. To setup the environment (Tensorflow + TFLearn) follow the below steps.

### Setup

Follow the steps given on this repository to setup you required tensorflow Environment [Link:prashplus/ML](https://github.com/prashplus/ML).

## 1. Data Preprocessing
